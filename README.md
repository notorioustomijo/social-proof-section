## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is the first time I'm actually using SCSS in a project so I'd say my learnings included:
* Figuring out how to organize my stylesheets
* Using SCSS @import and learning how it works
* Nesting in SCSS
* @mixins 
* Implementing media queries in SCSS

### Continued development

I plan to continue to use SCSS in my projects moving forward to master that language and get extremely comfortable using it.

### Useful resources

- [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/) - This helped me with my media queries in particular. I needed to have an idea of what particular breakpoints I should use and this helped.
